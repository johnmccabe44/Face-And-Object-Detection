# Face-And-Object-Detection

This project compares the effectivesness of classical CV techniques such as HOG and SURF feature extraction used in conjunction with SVM classifiers against Deep Learning models with transfer learning such as Alexnet and InceptionV3.

There is also an exploration of some of the latest object detection models such a Faster-RCNN.

Both explorations highlight the challenges of face and object detection, namely the requirement for large amounts of training data and consierable computational power.

Included in this repository is the Matlab code used and the report of the findings (with faces redacted).
